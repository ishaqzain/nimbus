### Getting Started

Get started by cloning the repo and installing dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ishaqzain/nimbus.git
$ cd nimbus
$ npm install
```

Make sure that you also have the latest Node.js (at least 8.2.1) installed.

After installing dependencies, you can start up and serve the Vue App at http://localhost:8080, by running the below command. This will also start up and serve the living documentation at http://localhost:6060. These same instructions should work on both macOS and Windows.

```sh
$ npm start
```
